When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you need to access your repo on another computer, or want to share with someone else.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Might still be working on your local directory and don't want to merge just yet.
